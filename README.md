# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" - Porting to Python3 and TensorFlow

This repository contains code samples for my book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

I use this repository as an exercise to port the code to Python3 and make use of TensorFlow.
